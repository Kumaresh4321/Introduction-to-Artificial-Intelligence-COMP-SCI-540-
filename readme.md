Probabilistic Language Identification
Your detectives arrived at company X only to find an important piece of ev-
idence, a business letter, has been shredded. After painstakingly recovering
the pieces, the detectives reported to you that all they could do was to count
how many times each alphabet character appeared in the letter. Your mission,
should you choose to accept it, is to estimate whether the letter was written in
English or Spanish.
Reminder: you are allowed to discuss broad ideas with each other and
the teaching team (instructors, TAs, and PMs), but you should disclose broad
discussion points in comments. Additionally, you are allowed to use large lan-
guage models like chatGPT as long as you disclose the both the LLM and the
prompt(s) used.
